# OOP JS, MODULES AND BUNDLING

This is the matching the three cards game! This app is made using object-oriented JavaScript. It features a special class designed to keep track of user scores while puzzling the player when picking and matching up the card with the same card, either a bulbe or a lock. If they match three times consistently, guess what! you win at the end. Plus, it's got GreenSock (GSAP) for those smooth animations, making it super fun to use whether you're on your phone or computer.
